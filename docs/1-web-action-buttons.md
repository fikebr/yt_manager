# issue 1: add a "Web" button to the table

1) when the video_id field is set from the google api. replace the url with "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video_id}"

2) on the Video Queue UI page. add a new action button named "Web" to the table to the right of Archive.

3) when a user clicks the new "Web" button open that url in the desktop. just open it and let the OS decide what browser to use. do not wait for process output or error codes.
